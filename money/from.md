### 金钱怎么来的？

the origin: how money get distribute into system

after new china is founded.

金钱这个概念，是人为控制的，虽然有基础的概念，但是跟前端框架一样，一直在变动，几年变一个样，但是底部的商品却不会变化。

为什么商品的用处不会变化，价值却一直变， 而且还会受到政府政策的影响。好难懂啊。

按照下面的模式开始写， 开始对照经济名词开始，股市，公司股票等等。。。

--------------------------------------------->

货币兑换，当新的政府上台。

当新的政府上台，可以获取货币的方法， 给政府工作，卖东西(土地和贵重金属)给政府，货币兑换（美国政府兑换英国政府货币）

只有政府发布的货币超过他的价值时候，才会贬值，土地增值，政府资产就增值。。。

这个国家所有的资源都有主人，不是个人的，就是政府的。持有的金钱和物质，就是总和？还是两倍？？

70 people, country worth -> 100,000,000 dollars

absolutely evenly distributed.

30% resource -> governement 30,000,000 dollars (or work for government...)
1% resource -> each people 1,000,000 dollar each
               (500,000 land and house, 100,000 in precious metal 400,000 in mine,farm, food,etc...)

precious metal dont rot, whatsoever, right? like gold..

all people trade in precious metal -> 7,000,000 dollars note in circulation, each has 100,000 in money to use as currency.

now everyone can trade. so what do we have now.

government has 37,000,000 in real value, owe 7,000,000 to people. 

people has 63,000,000 in real value, own 7,000,000 of government, if it is promised, then, no problem, if government run away. people get robbed by whoever runs the government..... got it????  

government just safe keeping the precious metal, while everyone goes about their business. 

money note has real value, only government keep their promise.

second country has same exact situation. but only the money is measure in 60,000,000 RMB, which exactly worth the same as 
30,000,000 dollars.

new comer from foreign county, see his goods, get 1,000 dollar from the people. so he own 1,000 worth of the country, no matter it is governement or people. as long as it is up for sale, hence the embargo... lol, wow, 

**** that is how foreigner get his money, by selling goods or service, samething you do for governemnt

****** if you work for government, you get note as pay, with 30,000,000 siting there, that 100 dollar of these property is yours...

exchange rate for the foreigner, when he go back to home country, and other people want the currency to buy goods in that country, he exchange same worth of money to buy it.

问题列表：

物物交换系统，自己的东西交换与否，都会变坏？除了房子和粮食，但是也要保存，

那为什么金钱社会，任何商品只要卖出去就变得永久保存？

------------------------------》

以前金子是用来做货币的，本身也有价值。

把金钱当作粮食和土地！来看，就可以解释的通，不会贬值？？

但是土地，或者任何物质都有限？？ 。。。。。

假设世界上一切禁止，就你从一个人买了东西，发生了什么变化。

或者就你卖了东西给别人，又发生了什么变化。

great:::

use my model to explain everything that economist say... 

see that... wowow....

gdp increase when production increase, the the increase GDP, reflect on people who increased production, or even government that make money from invesetment...


GDP make sense??? or not??? only net worth is what is important, but GDP promise what I can create within given time, see it is kind of important as measure, when it is measure for real..

hwo job is created in this situation??

GNP > GDP, why switch from GDP to GNP....
