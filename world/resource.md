oxygen: through plant and sun 光合作用

BUT if human overpoplution super exceed the plant, the oxygen level could get low enough to cause death

such as New Delhi, Beijing, Shanghai etc air pollution problem.

water: sun evaporate dirty water and turn them into rain and fresh water

energy: from sun

material: all the desired material can be created through using energy from sun with chemical process. alchemstry, medicine whatnot.

### 能量守恒定律:

Earth need sun to create a livable enviorment for human, and all these organic beings.

other planet is fine without reciving sunlight, but it is only suitable for rocks, apparently.
