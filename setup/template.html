		<h3>A Fox, a Rabbit, and a Cabbage - 狐狸，兔子和白菜</h3>
		<p>Lorne Malvo is now posing as a dentist named "Dr. Michael" in Kansas City, Missouri. One night, Malvo, along with his fiance Jemma Stalone, throw a dinner party at his place which his co-worker Dr. Burt and his wife Louise attend. While Malvo and Burt have a chat over wine, Burt brings up his estranged brother, who is currently under witness protection, but still keeps contact with him even though he isn't allowed to. Burt drunkenly suggests they go to Las Vegas to visit him, Malvo agrees to it. Later that night, Malvo sits, alone, in his room listening to one of his phone recordings on his cassette tapes, involving a man committing suicide after confessing to Malvo that Malvo ruined his life.</p>

		<div>Lorne Malvo 现在冒充的身份是一位在Missouri州Kansis市的叫做"Dr. Michael"的牙医。一天晚上，Malvo同他的未婚妻Jemma Stalone在他的房子举办派对，他的同事Dr. Burt 和他的妻子Louis在与会人中。当Malvo和Burt饮酒交谈的时候，Burt提起他那个疏远的兄弟，虽然他的兄弟还在证人保护令不能跟外界联系，但是他们兄弟还是偷偷保持联系。Burt醉汹汹的提议他们去拉斯维加斯去跟他兄弟见面，Malvo随后表示赞成。那天晚上晚些时候，Malvo独自坐在他的房间里，听着一个用磁带记录下来的电话录音，是关于一个男人对Malvo哭诉他毁了他的生活，然后自杀的事情。</div>

		<p>In a Las Vegas casino bar, Malvo sits at a table talking to Burt, Louise, and Jemma as Lester Nygaard watches from the bar. Burt tells Mike they will meet his brother tomorrow, but they can't bring phones. Before Malvo can ask who is after his brother, Lester walks up to him and taps him on the shoulder. Malvo pretends not to recognize him, despite Lester's attempts to explain what happened in Minnesota last year. Malvo tells Burt that he has never met this man and suggests that they leave. As they get up from the table, Malvo quietly tells Lester, "Walk away."</p>

		<div>现在位于拉斯维加斯的一个赌场中的酒吧，Malvo坐在一个桌子边跟Burt，Louise和Jemma交谈着，Lester Nygaard在酒吧的另一旁看着他们。Burt告诉Malvo他们明天就会和他的兄弟会面，但是到时候不可以带电话来。就在Malvo正要询问他谁在追察他的兄弟的时候，Lester走到他的跟前，碰了碰他的肩膀。Malvo假作不认识他，尽管Lester尝试向他描绘去年在Minnesota州发生的事情。Malvo告诉Burt他从来没见过这个人，建议他们离开这个地方。在他们站起来的时候，Malvo小声的跟Lester讲“走开”</div>

		<p>As they get onto the elevator, Lester stops the elevator door at the last second and enters. He demands that Malvo recognize him, saying the "new Lester" will not let things slide as easily. Malvo tells him to stop talking, and he stares Lester down and asks if this is what he wants. Lester is confused and Malvo repeats the question, asking "Yes or no?". Lester says yes, and Malvo shoots Burt, Louise, and Jemma in the head. He tells Lester that's on him. As they continue to ride the elevator, Malvo explains that he had been working Burt for six months in order to get to his brother, who apparently has a $100,000 bounty which has now gone to waste. The elevator arrives at a service floor and Malvo asks Lester to help move the bodies to the dumpster. Instead, Lester hits Malvo with his award and runs away. Malvo, smiling, watches Lester run away and says that he'll see him soon.</p>

		<div>在他们搭载电梯的时候，Lester在最后一秒拦住电梯的门，然后也一起进入电梯。他要求Malvo说他认识他，他还说“新的Lester”不像以前那个可以随便打发了。Malvo叫他不要再讲了，然后他瞪着眼看着他，问他你是否确定要这么做。Lester开始变得糊涂了，Malvo重复了一遍问题，然后问“是还是不是”。Lester说是，Malvo拔枪把Burt，Louise和Jemma都给爆了头。他然后跟Lester说这个都是他引起的。搭乘的电梯仍然在运行中，Malvo解释道他花了6个月时间才找到他的兄弟，原来这个兄弟头上有10万美元的悬赏，现在一切都打了水漂。电梯这时到达服务的楼层，Malvo要Lester帮他把尸体都搬到垃圾箱里。不止没有帮他，Lester反而用他的奖杯打了Malvo然后逃走。Malvo笑着看着Lester跑着，然后说他很快就会见到他的。</div>

		<p>Lester reaches his hotel room and makes Linda, his wife, get up and pack. He quickly leads her out of the hotel and they catch a late-night plane back to Minnesota. Meanwhile, in Fargo, North Dakota, an FBI agent asks Budge and Pepper to pull the file for the Fargo syndicate massacre. This immediately sparks their interest, and they ask why he needs to file. He tells them a deputy from Bemidji has been calling them, and they decide to pay the deputy a visit.</p>

		<div>Lester回到他旅馆的房间，让他的妻子Linda起来并收拾行李。他快速的带着她离开了旅馆然后搭乘一个晚班飞机飞到了Minnesota。同一时间在北卡州Fargo市，一个FBI探员要Budge和Pepper关于Fargo犯罪团伙被大残杀的档案。这立即引起他们的兴趣，然后他们问这个探员他为什么要这个档案。他告诉他们一个来自Bemidji的警员一直打电话要这些档案，于是他们打算去拜访这个警员。</div>

		<p>At Lou's Coffee Shop, Lou serves breakfast to Molly, Gus, and Greta. They discuss the time when Bill Oswalt posed for a newspaper article, and mention he is currently in Saint Paul for a law enforcement conference, and Molly is in charge until he returns. Gus leaves to take Greta to school and Molly gets a call from the Nevada Police Department. They ask her to follow up on a case about three people being murdered on an elevator at a casino by interviewing a witness that called it in: Lester Nygaard.</p>

		<div>在Lou开的咖啡馆，Lou为Molly，Gus和Greta端上早餐。他们讨论了Bill Oswalt那次上了新闻文章的事情，然后提到他现在还在Saint Paul参加一个执法部门的会议，Molly在他回来之前执掌警局。Gus开车带Greta去学校，Molly接到一个来自Nevada警察局的电话。他们请求她跟进一个在赌场发生的3人在电梯被枪杀的案子，希望她可以去探访一下打电话通知这个事情的目击者人：Lester Nygaard。</div>

		<p>As Lester and Linda are driving home, Linda asks if leaving early was her fault. He assures her it has nothing to do with her, and decides they should go to Mexico for a vacation right away to make it up to her. After pulling into the driveway of their house (which has changed in the past year to a much larger house with surrounding woods), Lester tells Linda to go inside and pack for their trip, saying to himself they will probably never come back. As she goes upstairs, Lester checks everywhere to be sure Malvo isn't waiting for him. He goes into the basement and pulls out Chaz's old hunting gear from a pile of boxes. In it is a bear trap, as well as a pistol with magazines, which he puts in his back pocket.</p>

		<div>在Lester和Linda开车回家的路上，Linda问道这么早就离开是不是因为她做错了什么。他向她保证说到这跟她一点都没有关系，并决定他们应该去墨西哥度假来补偿她。在把车停进房子(在过去一年已经变成四周都是树林的大房子)的车道后，Lester叫Linda进去收拾行李去墨西哥，并对自己默默说到可能以后就不会回来了。在她上楼的时候，Lester检查四周来确保Malvo没有在附近等候他。他进入地下室，然后从一堆箱子中找出Chazz的以前的打猎用具。在里面有一个熊夹，还有一个手枪，他把这个手枪放进他的后口袋中。</div>

		<p>Before Lester can leave for his office, Molly arrives at the front door to ask about the murders in Vegas. Lester tries to send her off, but Linda lets her come in due to needing to use the restroom. Meanwhile, Gus is on his mail route when he sees a red car pass by. He gets a quick glimpse of the driver, and believes him to be Lorne Malvo. Malvo drives to Lester's old house with plans to kill Lester, only to find out that he has moved and a new family is now living there. Malvo deviously tells them that there were multiple murders in the house at one point, and it could be haunted. He leaves and goes to Lester's workplace, where he now has his own insurance company. He finds it to be closed.</p>

		<div>在Lester即将离开去办公室的时候，Molly来到前门来询问关于拉斯维加斯谋杀案的事情。Lester尝试打发走她，但Linda却让她进入房子让她使用厕所。同一时间，Gus在送信的途中看到一辆红色的车从他旁边经过。他瞥了驾驶员一眼，认为这个开车的人是Lorne Malvo。Malvo驶向Lester的旧房子打算去杀了Lester，却发现他已经搬家了，而另一个家庭则住在这里。Malvo拐弯抹角的告诉现在房子的主人，这个房子以前发生过几起谋杀，现在可能会闹鬼。他然后离开去Lester工作的地方，Lester现在已经有自己的保险公司了。他发现公司的门是关着。</div>

		<p>Meanwhile, Molly talks with Lester and Linda about the events of the murder. Lester makes up a story, saying he never met anyone on his way back to the hotel room. Molly asks why they tried to board a plane at the last minute, Linda backs up Lester's story by saying she was homesick. Molly finishes up and leaves, but before she does she tells them the Vegas PD will be sending over some security footage, so they shouldn't leave town for a while. Linda is about to bring up their trip, but Lester assures Molly they will stay put.</p>

		<div>同一时间，Molly跟Lester和Linda谈及谋杀的事情，Lester捏造了一个故事，说他在回旅馆房间的过程中没有遇见任何人。Molly问他为什么在最后一分钟决定搭飞机回来，Linda说这是因为她想家了来为Lester圆谎。在Molly结束对话打算离开之前，她告诉他们拉斯维加斯的警察局会给他们传过来一些安全闭路的视频，所以他们暂时不可以离开这个城镇。Linda正要告诉她他们要去旅行的事情，Lester阻止了她，并向Molly保证他们会呆着城镇里。</div>

		<p>Returning to her car, Molly gets a call from the Bemidji PD, saying two FBI agents were at the department looking for her, and were sent to Lou's to find her, and suggests she go over there. Before she goes, she sees Lester watching her from his window. At the diner, Malvo arrives and orders a coffee and a slice of apple pie. Malvo deduces Lou was a cop at one point, Lou tells him he was one for eighteen years. The two of them exchange stories of their previous affiliations with the police, though Malvo doesn't mention his very specifically. Malvo tries to change the subject by asking where he can find Lester's new residence, which Lou doesn't know. Lou becomes suspicious, and brings up the Sioux Falls case, and tells him what happened there, which gets Malvo's attention. Molly pulls into the back parking lot of the shop, and enters through the back door as Malvo exits through the front. Bill and Webb arrive shortly after to ask Molly about the Fargo case. Molly decides to show them her conspiracy board.</p>

		<div>回到她的车上，Molly接到Bemidji警察局的电话，说有两个FBI探员之前在局里找她，然后探员被告知去Lou的咖啡馆去找她，叫她去那里可以见到他们。在她开车离开之前，她发现Lester从他房子的窗户里观察着她。来到餐馆，Malvo点了一杯咖啡和一个苹果派。Malvo推测Lou以前是个警察，Lou告诉他他以前做过18年警察。两个人开始交谈他们以前与警察相关的故事，Malvo在交谈中隐藏了他是罪犯的细节。Malvo尝试转换话题，问他Lester的新家在哪里，Lou也不知道。Lou开始对他有了怀疑，然后跟他讲了Sioux Fall的案子，引起了Malvo的兴趣。Molly把车停到餐馆后面的停车场，在后门进入餐馆的时候，Malvo正好从前门离开了。Bill和Webb随后抵达，询问Molly关于Fargo的案子。Molly决定给他们看她的用来推论这个案子的纸板。</div>

		<p>At the Bemidji PD, Bill and Webb are amazed at Molly's work on the case. Suddenly Bill Oswalt returns from the conference, and is frustrated to see Molly's board out again. The two FBI agents calm him down, and decide they will be spending the night to further investigate, hoping to contact Lester. Back at home, Gus enters his room and looks at the more elaborate version of Molly's board. He studies the pictures of Malvo and tries to confirm whether or not he really saw Malvo drive past him.</p>

		<div>在Bemidji的警察局，Bill和Webb对Molly在案子做出的推论感到惊叹。突然Bill Oswalt开完会议后回来，看到Molly又把这个案子拿出来，感到十分的懊恼。两个FBI探员让他冷静下来，然后决定他们在这里过夜来继续调查这个案子，并希望可以联络到Lester。回到家里，Gus进入他的房间，看到了更加详细具体的Molly关于案子的推论纸板。他仔细观察了Malvo的照片来确定当时经过他的司机是否为Malvo。</div>

		<p>That night, Lester buys two online plane tickets out of Minneapolis while still constantly looking over his shoulder for Malvo. He tells Linda they're leaving soon. She reminds him they need to stay in town, Lester lies and says he talked with Molly and they are free to go. Before leaving town, Lester says they need to stop by the office to pick up some cash and their passports from the safe. In the parking lot, Lester notices a light on that he didn't turn on. Suspicious, he sends Linda into the office wearing his coat to get what they came for. Malvo appears inside the office and shoots Linda in the back of her head, thinking her to be Lester. Realizing his mistake, Malvo exits the building and scans the parking lot for Lester. Seeing no one, he lights a cigarette and walks away as Lester nervously watches from a distance.</p>

		<div>当天晚上，Lester买了两张离开Minneapolis市的机票，并不时的观察四周是否有Malvo的影子。他告诉Linda他们马上就要离开。她提醒他他们需要带着镇上，Lester撒谎对她说，他已经跟Molly交流过，他们已经可以离开了。来离开之前，Lester说他们需要去一趟办公室把他们的现金和护照从保险箱中取出来。在公司的停车场，Lester发现他之前没有打开的灯亮着。感到怀疑，他让Linda穿着她的外套去办公室里取他们需要的东西。Malvo出现在办公室里面，冲背后开枪打中了Linda的头，以为她是Lester。发现他杀错人后，Malvo离开办公室，在停车场寻找Lester的踪影。在没有发现任何人后，他点了一支烟然后离开了，而Lester则在远处担忧着看他。</div>
