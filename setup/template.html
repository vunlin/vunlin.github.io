		<h3>The Heap - 沙堆</h3>
		<p>Following Chazz Nygaard's arrest, Lester Nygaard consoles his sister-in-law, Kitty, who believes her husband is guilty. Shortly afterward, Lester tosses out Pearl's belongings, beginning a new life. Later, Gina Hess angrily storms into Lester's office, demanding payment from Sam's insurance policy and accusing Lester of having duped her and taken advantage of her sexually. Lester initially pretends he will make some calls on her behalf, but when her sons try to bully Lester, he hits them with a stapler, which in turn intimidates all three of the surviving Hess family members, and they back off. Additionally, Lester tells Mrs. Hess Sam's having stopped paying the policy indicates she won't get paid. Lester's dominant performance impresses Linda.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, Molly returns to work and unsuccessfully attempts to reopen the Lester Nygaard investigation. At the Duluth hospital, Malvo kills a police guard and gives Mr. Wrench the handcuff key to escape, telling him that he and Mr. Numbers came closer than anyone else ever had to besting Malvo. Malvo confesses that he killed Mr. Numbers and tells Wrench to come find him if he still wants revenge. In Fargo, FBI Agents Pepper and Budge, having been assigned to surveillance during Malvo's 22-homicide gun rampage and missed his having walked right by their car en route to entering the building, are demoted to file clerks.</p>

		<p>A year passes, and Gus Grimly, now a mailman, is happily married to Molly as they eagerly await their first child's birth. In Las Vegas, Lester, who has married his co-worker, Linda, receives an award for Insurance Salesman of the Year. While at the hotel bar, Lester spots Malvo, who now sports grey hair and a goatee rather than brown hair and a full beard. While conversing with his companions, Malvo calls himself "Dr. Michaelson".</p>
