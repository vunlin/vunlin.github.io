		<h3>Morton's Fork - Morton 岔路</h3>
		<p>The episode opens up showing the aftermath of a snowmobile crash. From the snowmobile, a trail of footprints are seen in the snow leading to a hole in the frozen lake.</p>

		<div>这一集一开始展示了一个雪地摩托车出事后的现场。从雪地摩托车开始，可以看到一串脚印在雪地上，一直延伸到冰冻湖面上的一个洞。</div>

		<p>Back in the parking lot outside Lester's workplace, Lester watches as Lorne exits the building after having killed his second wife Linda. Once Lorne leaves the area, Lester goes into the insurance shop in order to get the money from the safe. Before leaving, he covers up the crime scene in order to make it look like he was never there.</p>

		<div>回到Lester公司外的停车场，Lester看着Lorne枪杀他的第二任妻子Linda后离开办公楼。当Lorne离开这个地区后，Lester进入他的保险公司从保险箱中拿钱出来。在离开之前，他掩盖他在现场的痕迹，让其看起来他没有在这里出现过。</div>

		<p>Lester enters Lou's Coffee Shop, where he orders 2 grilled cheese sandwiches, telling Lou that Linda went to his office to get something and will be here soon. Lester indicates he's going to the bathroom but he leaves the Coffee Shop through the back door.</p>

		<div>Lester走进Lou的咖啡馆，点了两个芝士三明治，跟Lou说Linda去他的办公室去取东西，等一下就会来这里。Lester表示他要上个洗手间，但是却从后面悄悄的溜出去。</div>

		<p>Outside, Lester enters a phone booth and makes an anonymous call to Bemidji's Police Station. He reports shots being fired at an intersection which is near Lester's office. He continues his report despite being told by a voice on the phone that he should've dialed 911. Lester hangs up ignoring the voice on the other end of the phone, then sneaks back through the back door into the cafe.</p>

		<div>到了外面，Lester进入一个电话亭然后打了一个匿名电话给Bemidji警察局。他报告他在一个路口听到枪声，他说的路口就在他公司的旁边。尽管警局接线的人告诉他打电话给911，他还是一直讲给他听。然后不理会接线员把电话挂掉，偷偷的从咖啡馆后面又溜了回去。</div>

		<p>Lou brings him ordered drinks and Lester, in a nervous manner, makes excuses about Linda going to the office for something. To that Lou responds he already said that and asks if Lester wants the meals kept warm until Linda shows up. Lester replies she should be there any second now. Lou recalls his conversation with "a fella" (Lorne Malvo) who was looking for Lester. Lou says he offered to give Lester the man's number, but Lorne declined. He also didn't like Lorne's demeanor. Lou leaves Lester to his thoughts then.</p>

		<div>Lou把他点的饮料端来给他，Lester有点慌慌张张，然后尝试掩盖，告诉Lou说Linda去办公室去取东西。Lou回复说他已经说过了，然后问Lester要不要先把点的餐保暖等Linda来了以后再端上来。Lester回复到她应该马上就到了。Lou记起跟一个人（Lorne Malvo）的谈话，但是这个人再找Lester。Lou说他当时说可以把Lester的电话号码给他，但是Lorne拒绝了。他还说他不喜欢Lorne的行为举止。然后Lou就离开还在想事情的Lester。</div>

		<p>Lester then realizes that he had left the airplane tickets to Acapulco in the winter jacket he gave to Linda before she went into the office. Immediately thereafter, police cars with sirens rush along the Coffee Shop, presumably driving to Lester's office.</p>

		<div>Lester这时意识到他把去Acapulco的机票放在，他在Linda进入办公室时候，给她的冬大衣里，随即，警车从咖啡馆旁边呼啸而过，想必是开往Lester办公室的方向。</div>

		<p>At home, Molly Solverson receives word that another of Lester's wives has been murdered. Molly goes to the crime scene where she meets Lester. Lester tries but fails to retrieve the tickets from the jacket that Linda is wearing. The police bring Lester back to the station where he refuses to answer any questions. The next morning, Lester is allowed to return home, but must be accompanied by FBI agents Pepper and Budge.</p>

		<div>在家里，Molly Solverson接到消息Lester的第二个老婆被谋杀了。Molly来到犯罪现场见到Lester。Lester尝试从Linda穿在身上的大衣上取走机票，但是没有成功。警察把Lester带回警局，但是Lester拒绝回答任何问题。第二天早上，Lester被允许回家，但是必须有FBI探员Pepper和Budge的陪同。</div>

		<p>Meanwhile, Malvo goes to a used car lot and chats up one of the salesmen about one car that looks like an undercover police car, convincing him to allow the two to go for a test drive. The Salesman, the same young husband that Lester failed to sell life insurance to a year earlier, obliviously consents.</p>

		<div>与此同时，Malvo来到一个二手车场，搭上了一个销售员，说他对一个看起来很像卧底警察车的车有兴趣，说服他让他们两个一起试驾一下。这个售车员就是那个Lester一年前尝试卖保险给他但没有成功的年轻丈夫，没有任何警觉的同意了。</div>

		<p>Malvo later sees Lester being taken home by the FBI agents, and follows in his own car. During his trip home, Lester is asked about and solves the riddle of the Fox, the Rabbit and the Cabbage. Once they've returned Lester home, the two FBI agents remain outside. Apparently forced by Malvo, the Salesman drives his car up to Lester's house. The FBI agents, suspicious, order the driver out. With both agents focused on the car, Malvo emerges from the surrounding woods and murders both of them and presumably the Salesman as well.</p>

		<div>Malvo随后看到Lester被FBI探员带回家，然后开车跟着他们。在回家的路上，Lester被问及“狐狸，兔子和白菜”的难题，并解答了这个难题。在他们把Lester送回家里后，他们仍然守在家外面。很明显受到Malvo的威胁，售车员把车开到了Lester的房子前面。起疑的FBI探员叫司机出来。当两个探员把注意力放在车上的时候，Malvo从旁边的树林中出现，开枪射杀了他们两个，据推测也杀了那个售车员。</div>

		<p>Malvo enters Lester's house, and each stalks but fails to kill the other. Malvo strikes Lester in the face with Lester's award, bloodying his face and mirroring the injury inflicted on Lester by Sam Hess a year earlier. Though Lester's gun jams, Malvo's foot is caught in a bear trap left by Lester, and escapes severely injured.</p>

		<div>Malvo进入Lester的房子，两个人都悄悄的接近想要杀掉对方，但是都没有成功。Malvo用Lester的奖杯打中了Lester的脸，让他血流满面，跟他一年前因为Sam Hess而受到伤相像。虽然Lester的枪卡壳了，Malvo的脚被捕熊器夹住，受了重伤，然后逃走。</div>

		<p>Malvo retreats to his nearby cabin to treat his injury, not knowing that Grimly has already found it. Grimly kills Malvo. When the police arrive, they find Malvo's trove of audio tapes, including the one containing Lester's confession for the murder of his first wife.</p>

		<div>Malvo退到他在附近的一个小屋子里来处理他的伤口，但是不知道其实Grimly已经找到这个地方了。Grimly杀掉了Malvo。警察到了之后，他们找到Malvo收集的录音磁带，里面包含有Lester杀害他前任妻子的坦白。</div>

		<p>Two weeks later, Lester is shown on a snowmobile in Glacier National Park in Montana. Being sought now that his role in his wife's death has been established, Lester is recognized by law enforcement officers also on snowmobiles. Lester tries to escape only to crash his snowmobile. Desperate, he escapes on foot, only to crash through thin ice, presumably meeting his end, and revealing that the scene shown at the beginning of the episode depicted Lester's fate.</p>

		<div>两个星期之后，Lester出现在Montana的Glacier国家公园，开着一个雪上摩托车。在确认他是杀害妻子的凶手后被警方通缉。Lester被乘坐雪地摩托车的警察认了出来，Lester尝试逃跑但是翻了车。不顾一切的他尝试跑走，但是却弄碎薄冰，沉入湖底，应该是死去了。揭示这一集一开始的镜头描述了Lester的命运。</div>

		<p>At home, Molly receives the news of Lester. Gus tells her that he's receiving a citation for bravery, but he feels that she deserves it. Molly reassures her husband that this is his moment.</p>

		<div>在家里，Molly听到关于Lester的消息。Gus告诉她他收到了英勇奖章，但是他觉得她比他更有资格得到他。Molly对她的丈夫确保到这是属于他的时刻。</div>
