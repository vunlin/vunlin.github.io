<h3>The Six Ungrapables - 六不收</h3>
<p>The episodes starts with a flashback on how Lester obtained the gun which eventually was used by Malvo to kill the officer during Lester's arrest at his own home. While in jail, Numbers and Wrench obtain Malvo's name from Lester. They are released but Lester, whose hand has become severely infected after being hit by one of the shot gun pellets that Malvo fired at Chief Thurman, is taken to the hospital. Molly rides in the ambulance and tries to get more information from Lester, though he is slightly delirious. She presents her evidence to Chief Oswalt, who is beginning to realize that all the recent events are related. With Stavros close to paying the blackmail demand, Malvo locks Chumph in his kitchen pantry overnight to prevent him from ruining the scheme. Malvo takes Stavros home and leaves. He spots Grimly parked by the road near the house and later follows Grimly to his home, but is confronted in his car by Grimly's neighbor. He threatens the neighbor before driving away.</p>

<div>这一集一开始就回放Lester是怎么取得那把最终被Malvo用来在他于家里被逮捕的时候枪杀警长的枪的一切经过。在监狱中，“数字”和“扳手”从Lester身上得知了Malvo的名字。他们最后被释放，但是Lester的手在Malvo开枪射击警长Thurman的时候被流弹击中而感染发炎，因此被送往医院。Molly随同坐在救护车中，尝试从Lester身上获得有用的信息，虽然Lester已经神志不清了。她把她的证据呈现给渐渐开始理解事情来由的警长Oswalt。Stavros已经十分接近支付勒索，于是Malvo把Chumph锁在他的厨房食物柜中过夜，以防止他把事情搞砸。Malvo把Stavros送回家然后离开。他看见Grimly把车停在房子旁边的路上，然后跟踪Grimly到他的房子，但是遭遇上Grimly的邻居。他在威胁了邻居后离开。</div>
