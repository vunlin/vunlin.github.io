<h3>Buridan's Ass - 布里丹之驴</h3>
<p>Lorne Malvo has Don Chumph place the call to Stavros, who has the money ready for the drop. Malvo knocks Chumph unconscious and duct tapes him to an exercise bench in the entry way of his house. He also duct tapes an unloaded shotgun to his hands and proceeds to fire randomly into the neighborhood with another gun. Malvo quickly exits out the backdoor before police arrive. They are duped into firing upon and then storming the house, killing Chumph who is struggling wildly to get free of his bonds.</p>

<div>Lorne Malvo让Don Chumph打电话给已经准备交付勒索金的Stavros。随后Malvo打晕Chumph，然后用胶布把他绑在他房子入口前厅的一个运动长凳上。他随后也把一把没有上子弹的霰弹枪用胶布绑在他的手上，然后开始用另一把枪向小区随意开枪。在警察到达之前，Malvo就已经快速的从后门离开。警察被误导后开始向房子开枪然后冲进房子，这个过程杀死了正在疯狂挣扎尝试摆脱捆绑的的Chumph。</div>

<p>Molly is visiting Grimly in Duluth to discuss the recent murders when gunshots are reported. At the scene they find a car wreck that Numbers and Wrench staged to trap Malvo. A shootout ensues in a snowy whiteout. Malvo escapes the ambush and captures and tortures Numbers to tell him who sent them. Numbers replies, "Fargo" before Malvo fatally slits his throat. Molly and Grimly get separated and Gus accidentally shoots her.</p>

<div>Molly在Duluth城镇来访Grimly，跟他讨论最近的谋杀案的时候，得知到发生了一起枪击事件。来到事发现场，他们找到“数字”和“扳手”准备用于困住Malvo的汽车残骸。随后，枪战在大雪漫天的环境中展开。Malvo逃离伏击，并捕获然后折磨“数字”来得知谁是他们的幕后主使人。在Malvo割断他喉咙之前，“数字”对他说：“Fargo”。Molly和Grimly分开后，Gus不小心开枪击中了她。</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Stavros goes back to the roadside where he originally found the briefcase of cash, and buries the blackmail money there, believing God has been punishing him. Feeling God's forgiveness, Stavros calls his bodyguard to bring his son, Dmitri, home from the remote hideout he was staying at. The stormy weather clears, but not before fish fall out of the sky in a freak occurrence caused by the storm, causing the bodyguard to flip the car, killing himself and Dmitri, a scene that Stavros happens upon on his drive home.</p>

<div>同一时间，认为这是上天对他的惩罚，于是Stavros回到当时他找到现金箱子的地方，然后把勒索金埋了回去。感觉得到了上天的原谅，Stavros打电话给他的保镖，让他把他的儿子Dmitri从他现在呆着的藏身之所带回家。风暴之天开始变晴朗，但是在变晴朗之前，从天空中下了一场鱼，导致保镖翻车，杀死了自己和Dimitri，Stavros在他回家的路上正好遇见这一切。</div>

<p>Back in Bemidji, Lester manages to sneak out of the hospital, stealing a car. He takes the murder weapon, some photos of his wife, and a pair of her panties from his house, hides everything in his brother Chazz's hidden gun cabinet, and places one of his brother's unloaded guns in his nephew Gordo's backpack, to ensure the police will search Chazz's house. As he leaves the house, Gordo sees him, but does not react. Lester then returns undetected to his hospital room, where a satisfied smile slowly creeps across his face.</p>

<div>视线回到Bemidji城镇，Lester想到办法然后悄悄离开医院，还偷了一辆车。他带着谋杀的武器，一些他老婆的照片，和在他房子中找到的老婆的内裤，然后把所有东西都藏在他哥哥Chazz的秘密枪柜中，然后把他哥哥的一把未上子弹的枪放进他侄子Gordo的书包里，来保证警察来搜查Chazz的房子。当他离开房子的时候，Gordo看见他，但是没有做出任何反应。Lester然后悄悄的回到医院的房间，一个满足的笑容慢慢的出现在他的脸上。</div>
